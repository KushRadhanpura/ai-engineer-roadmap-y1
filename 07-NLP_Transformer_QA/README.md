# 07-NLP_Transformer_QA

This project is a technical Question-Answering system that can find answers in a body of text. It's built using the Hugging Face `transformers` library, leveraging a pre-trained BERT model fine-tuned for question answering.

## How it works

The system takes a context (a body of text) and a question as input, and it returns the most likely answer from the context.

## How to run

1. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python qa_system.py
   ```
