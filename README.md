# AI Engineer Journey

My first step into AI: a hands‑on portfolio of end‑to‑end projects covering data collection, EDA, model training, APIs, deployment, Kaggle, deep learning, LLM fine‑tuning, and RAG/agents.

## Highlights

- 9+ production‑oriented projects
- Mix of classic ML, deep learning, and modern LLM workflows
- Reproducible folders with their own READMEs and requirements
- Tests included for the Transformer QA module

## Repository structure

- `01-Data_Collector/` — Web scraping pipeline and exportable dataset
- `02-data-analysis-report/` — EDA notebooks and cleaned data
- `03-api-deployment/` — FastAPI service to serve book data
- `04-kaggle/` — House Prices: data, notebook, and submission template
- `05-deep-learning-core/` —
	- `01-nn-numpy-scratch/` minimal NN from scratch
	- `02-pytorch-cifar10-classifier/` CNN classifier for CIFAR‑10
- `06-The_ML_Core/` — Transfer learning classifier and LSTM sentiment analysis
- `07-NLP_Transformer_QA/` — Transformer‑based QA system with tests
- `08-Fine_Tuning_LLM/` — API and scripts for LLM fine‑tuning and inference
- `09-AI_Agents/` — RAG chatbot with Google Gemini integration

Each subfolder has a focused README; start there for setup and run steps.

## Quick start

1) Clone the repo and open the subproject you want to run.
2) Read that folder’s `README.md` and install its `requirements.txt` if present.
3) Run the module (API, notebook, or training script) as documented in that folder.

Tip: Use isolated virtual environments per project to avoid dependency conflicts.

## Gallery (add your images in `assets/`)

Include a few clean screenshots to make the portfolio stand out:

- Repo overview and folder tree (`assets/repo-overview.png`)
- EDA charts or notebook visuals (`assets/eda.png`)
- CIFAR‑10 training curves or confusion matrix (`assets/cifar-metrics.png`)
- QA system tests passing (`assets/qa-tests.png`)
- Fine‑tuning logs/results (`assets/finetune.png`)
- RAG chatbot demo conversation (`assets/rag-demo.png`)

> See `assets/README.md` for a complete image checklist and sizing tips.

## Repository name ideas

If you want a timeless, memorable name (no time frame):

- `ai-engineer-journey` (recommended)
- `ai-engineering-foundations`
- `ai-engineer-starter-kit`
- `ai-engineering-portfolio`

After renaming on GitHub, update your local remote URL to match the new name.

## LinkedIn blurb (copy/paste)

My first step into AI: an end‑to‑end engineering portfolio. From data collection and EDA to deep learning, APIs, LLM fine‑tuning, and a RAG chatbot — all organized and reproducible. Repo link below; feedback welcome!

Focus areas: scraping, FastAPI, Kaggle, PyTorch (CIFAR‑10), transfer learning, LSTM, transformer QA with tests, fine‑tuning, and RAG/agents.
