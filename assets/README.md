# Assets guide

Use this folder to store images for the main README and your LinkedIn post.

Recommended images to include (filenames are suggestions):

1. repo-overview.png — Full repo screenshot with folders visible
2. folder-tree.png — Clean tree view (or code screenshot) of top-level structure
3. eda.png — Best EDA chart from `02-data-analysis-report`
4. api-demo.png — `03-api-deployment` FastAPI docs (Swagger UI) or a test request
5. kaggle-results.png — House Prices notebook highlight (score/insights)
6. cifar-metrics.png — Training curves / confusion matrix from CIFAR-10
7. qa-tests.png — Passing tests for `07-NLP_Transformer_QA`
8. finetune.png — Fine-tuning result or inference output
9. rag-demo.png — RAG chatbot conversation snippet
10. banner.png — Social header for GitHub/LinkedIn

Sizing and quality tips:

- LinkedIn prefers 1200×627 (landscape) or square 1080×1080; PNG is fine.
- Keep text large and high-contrast; avoid busy backgrounds.
- Add short, readable titles inside the image when helpful.
- Export at 2× scale for crisp rendering on retina screens.

Alt text suggestions:

- "Repository overview and project folders"
- "CIFAR-10 training curves and accuracy"
- "Transformer QA tests passing"
- "RAG chatbot demo response"

Keep this folder in Git by leaving this README or a `.gitkeep` file alongside your images.
