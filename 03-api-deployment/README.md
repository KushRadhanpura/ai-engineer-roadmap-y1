ðŸŒŸ Project Goal (AI Accelerated 1 Year Plan - Month 3)

The primary objective was to deploy a reliable service that securely connects to a PostgreSQL database and exposes the cleaned dataset, providing a stable foundation for future AI model consumption.

âœ… Key Tasks & Outcomes
Task 1: Secure Data Migration
Action: Used the secure Python script (upload_data.py) to transfer 1000 cleaned records into the remote PostgreSQL database (books_data table).

Data Artifact: The final, cleaned, and verified data artifact exported directly from the live database is committed here: 03-api-deployment/books_clean_exported.csv.

Task 2: Credential and Connection Hardening
Challenge Solved: Resolved persistent connection errors by refactoring the application to ensure all database connection pools consistently read the DATABASE_URL environment variable.

Security: Enforced the mandatory SSL connection parameter (sslmode=require) to securely connect the Render Web Service to the PostgreSQL database.

Best Practice: All sensitive secrets were successfully isolated from the source code and managed via Render's environment variables.

Task 3: API Validation
Outcome: Successfully deployed the web service (ai-demo-q57b) and validated database connectivity.

Proof: The test endpoint returned a successful data count, confirming the API layer is operational: {"data_source": "xyz_db_123", "record_count": 1000}.

ðŸš€ Status & Contribution
This project is complete and ready for integration into subsequent AI workflow modules.
